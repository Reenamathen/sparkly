This is my first attempt at the Black Friday practice dataset on Analytics Vidya. My env is on Spark and Jupyter Notebook using the Anaconda Python. 
This dataset has more than 500k entries in the training set and 200k in the test set. The aim to predict the sales for a given product ID and User.
In the first run I have used simple Linear Regression available as part of the Spark ML library.With this I was able to get to the 316th position on the leaderboard.
